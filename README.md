# Detroit Blight Ticket Compliance
Classifier used to predict if an issued blight ticket will be paid on time

The City of Detroit needs help in dealing with the big issue of blight compliance. Every year, Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents that fail to maintain their property and these fines often end up unpaid. Enforcing compliance can be difficult in terms of costs.
This project will analyze why a Detroit resident might fail to pay a blight ticket by using various classifiers to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time. The dataset that is used for analysis is courtesy of the Detroit Open Data Portal.
